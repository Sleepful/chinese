Hello you! I'm creating this blog with the purpose of keeping an online-notebook of study notes. <!--truncate--> 

I'm going to be studying the Chinese language, and I will be keeping track of my path on this website, maybe in the future it can be a a reference guide for me, or perhaps a study guide for someone else! It's a large commitment, hopefully I am able to reach my expectations with it, and maybe keeping this blog as a part of the endeavour will help with my motivation. ðŸ˜… 
 
Amidst the idea of making this website, I was wondering if I want to make this page a place for notes of different topics that I would like to study, but that might be too ambitious right now, so I will keep it focused to one topic, and perhaps make separate blogs for new topics when the time comes for new topics.

The plan is to research my own Chinese study-resources, keep the notes I make on this website, and complement my study by making my own [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) "flashcards" to help with memorization.
 
If you are curious about how I made this website, I am doing it with the help of [Docusaurus 2 alpha](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). It's a *static-website generator for software documentation*, but no one will stop you if you use it for something else, so I figured it was ideal for keeping study notes online. The other *static-website generator for software documentation* that got on my radar were [docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) and [mdBook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). I ended up choosing Docusaurus due to higher flexibility in exchange for a little bit more complexity, it comes with a template for this blog so that's a plus. Docsify on the other hand seems simpler to use, but less flexible, it is also a good choice if you are looking to publish notes online. And finally, I use netlify to put my docusaurus website on the web.
